This is for the Bottlerocket test application built in ~30 hours.

I used react, an API wrapper in react for the google map, and flex css. 

There is one error when pulling up the map more than one time a day because I haven't linked a billing account to the API key. The map still functions as necessary, it's just darkened with some writing on it.
